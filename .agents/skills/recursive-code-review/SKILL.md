# recursive-code-review

Use a dedicated Review sub-agent to critique uncommitted code changes without modifying them directly. Apply the feedback, then repeat the review cycle with a new sub-agent until no meaningful issues remain or the review converges. 

## When to use

Use this skill when reviewing staged or unstaged code changes before committing, improving implementation quality through iterative critique or validating that recent edits do not introduce bugs, regressions, maintainability issues, or missing tests. 

This skill is especially useful when:
- making nontrivial code changes
- refactoring existing code
- working across multiple files or services
- using AI-generated code
- preparing changes for a commit or pull request
- validating fixes after addressing review feedback

## Instructions

1. Identify all staged and unstaged changes in the repository.
2. Generate a diff of the uncommitted changes to use as the review target. 
3. Launch a dedicated review subagent with the following constraints:
- The reviewer may analyze and critique the diff.
- The reviewer must not modify files.
- The reviewer should focus on correctness, regressions, maintainability, readability, test coverage, performance implications, security concerns, and risky patterns.
- The reviewer should return actionable feedback with clear reasoning, severity, and relevant references.
4. Review the feedback and determine which issues should be addressed.
5. Apply fixes directly in the working tree. 
6. After making changes, generate an updated diff and launch a new isolated review agent with no memory of the previous review passes. 
7. Repeat the review in a fixed cycle until reviewers stop finding meaningful issues or feedback becomes repetitive and low value. 
8. Before finishing, summarize issues identified, fixes applied, and remaining concerns, if any.
